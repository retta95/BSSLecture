### Question 1
#### Part A
Image of handwritten calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors:![q1p1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64221087/140610263-2ec08f55-c7d7-4ab1-8ec7-b355457eeef9.JPG)
#### Part B
Eigenvalues and eignvectors calculated based on the eig matlab function and power method for eigenvalue decomposition. The test below was added to the E02_testEigenAnalysisPowerMethod.m Matlab script:

#### Part B
In order to export the principal vector iteration, the Eigen Analysis Power Method matlab function was updated and the principle vecots of each of the values:

### Question 3
#### Part A
updated scripts are in the folder and commented: 
#### Part B
- Code 1: Ex01_testPCA.m
- Code 2: Ex02_Ex02_testEigenAnalysisPowerMethod.m
The script was updated in question 2 where the eigenvalues of a C matrix were calculated. The updated scripts also has a plot of the principle vector calculation. 
- Code 3: Ex03_testICAmethods.m
- Code 4: Ex04_testEOGArtifactRemoval.m
- Code 5: Ex05_testFetalECGExtraction.m
